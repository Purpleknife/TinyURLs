# TinyURLs ✂️

TinyURLs is an app that allows users to shorten long URLs.

This project's goal is to revisit an old project made with Node JS, Express and EJS templates: [TinyApp](https://github.com/Purpleknife/tinyapp), and rebuild it using TypeScript and React.

<strong><h3>🔴 This project's goals are:</h3></strong>
- Learn TypeScript.
- Learn how to use TypeScript with React.
- Learn how to pass down and handle props with TypeScript.
- Learn how to manage state with TypeScript.

## Features
- [X] A user can generate a short URL by submitting a long URL. 
- [X] They can login or register to save their generated tiny URLs.
- [X] They can delete or edit the URLs.
- [X] They can see how many times their tiny URL was clicked.
- [ ] Styling (=> <i>in progress</i>)

## Testing
- [X] Since the project is limited in scope, I decided to include some tests for different parts of the application.

The result of these tests is now 100% coverage.
