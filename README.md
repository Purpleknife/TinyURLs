# TinyURLs ‚úÇÔ∏è

TinyURLs is an app that allows users to shorten long URLs.

This project's goal is to revisit an old project made with Node JS, Express and EJS templates: [TinyApp](https://github.com/Purpleknife/tinyapp), and rebuild it using TypeScript, React JS and Express.

<strong><h3>üî¥ This project's goals were:</h3></strong>
- Learn TypeScript.
- Learn how to use TypeScript with React.
- Learn how to pass down and handle props with TypeScript.
- Learn how to manage state with TypeScript.

## Features
- [X] A user can generate a short URL by submitting a long URL. 
- [X] They can login or register to save their generated tiny URLs.
- [X] They can delete or edit the URLs.
- [X] They can see how many times their tiny URL was clicked.
- [X] When they click on a tiny UR;, they're redirect to its long URL.
- [X] They can see how many times the URL was clicked and when was the last visit.

## Testing with Jest
Since the project is limited in scope, I decided to include some tests for different parts of the app.

The result of these tests is 100% coverage.
